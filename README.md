# About me
**Max Zimmer** <br>
Research Area Lead of <a href="https://iol.zib.de/research/iol-learn.html">iol.LEARN</a> at the <a href="https://iol.zib.de/">IOL Lab</a> of <a href="https://www.zib.de/">Zuse Institute Berlin</a><br>
4th-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/math">TU Berlin</a><br>
Advisor: <a href="http://www.pokutta.com/">Prof. Dr. Sebastian Pokutta</a><br>

**Research:** My research primarily focuses on developing methods to enhance the compute and memory efficiency of large Neural Networks through techniques like sparsity, pruning, and quantization. While this work aims to make Deep Learning more sustainable, I also leverage large models to address sustainability challenges, such as creating global canopy height maps for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation. I'm also interested in using Deep Learning for scientific discovery, particularly for solving pure mathematical problems. Additionally, I worked on Federated Learning, Interpretability, and Optimization. Check out my [homepage](https://maxzimmer.org/) for a full list of my publications.
